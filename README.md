# Skeleton Code

this reposiory will include the skeleton code that mr harman has presented us with and will have it in an organised format that is easier for me to understand. if its not easier for you to understand then too bad ðŸ˜¢

I have made three folders named "MrHarmanCommented", "unedditedCode" and "nomabaCommented". These three folders will include the same code but with differences in the way that they have been commented.

"unedditedCode" contains code that has been provided in the same raw format that it was provided in by AQA.
"MrHarmanCommented" contains code that has been commented by Mr Harman himself so you can comfirm that these comments will be acurate and reliable.
"nomabaCommented" contsins code that has been commented by nomaba so expect there to be some mistakes in the commenting. Please contact me about any errors that you find.

I have separted all of the subroutines into different files and have put them in the folders called "subroutines".
These folders can be found in the "MrHarmanCommented", "unedditiedCode" and the "nomabaCommented" folders.

Code in folders by the name of "LineByLineComments" will have each and every line commented but these comments will only pay respect to the line that they are in. The will not have any consideraton of context around that line

The code may not be indented properly because when i imported the code into github it lost all of its indentation so i had to indent it myself.

Please contact me if there are any errors in the code or if the code has not been indented propely.
